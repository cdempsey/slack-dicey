# Dicey for Slack

A small [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) application that adds a slash
command to a [Slack](https://slack.com/) team that integrates with
[Rolz.org](https://rolz.org/)'s [API](https://rolz.org/help/api) to allow users
to roll virtual dice.

```
/roll 3d6 - *rolls 3 six-sided dice*
/roll d100 - *rolls 2 ten-sided dice to generate a number between 1 and 100*
```

See [Rolz Help Page](https://rolz.org/help/index) for more dice expressions that
 can be used.
